# linearregression
This is a basic code which is used to predict petrol prices specifically in Chennai. I have developed this by thinking that petrol prices are always going to rise, so this model will help you to look at the petrol prices in future if the petrol prices continue to rise in the current manner.

Petrol prices for the month of November (2019) is included. You can try it yourself as well :).
